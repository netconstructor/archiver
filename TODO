BUGS
- emails with non 7bit headers are trashed (it should be ok since, they aren't rfc compliant)
- bcc mails (no recipients) are trashed (now archived using envelops) - possible fix: postfix 2 can add:
  Delivered-To: header with envelope address, but this will slow down the mail system
- unix sockets and asyncore are not friends, you should use only tcp sockets
- thread interlock stuff sometime doesn't work, i.e. if lock check is enabled
  archiver will not shutdown in a clean way

TODO 2.x:
- [done] Split out history and readme from archver.py and make different files
- [done] Split the server to two threads 1st and 2nd stage using different unix sockets
- [done] Use lmtp on listening unix sockets
- [done] Modularize Data and Storage Backends
- [done] Call init/shutdown for each backend
- [done] Check duplicate headers - check
         clamav sends mails with multiple cc
         http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=213509&mbox=yes
- [done unix socket/asyncore is buggy] Use lmtp or smtp for listening services (integrates with amavisd-new)
- [done] Multiple from support
- [done] Rework configurations system - use ConfigParses
- [done] Implement backends
- [done] Make a class object for logger
- [done] Move common backend exceptions class in archiver.py and import
- [done] SQL tables are in dir sql/ - postfix confs are in dir postfix/
- [done] Add error handling and auto-reconnection to backend rdbms
- [done] Add 'Archived as' as 200 result code
- [done] lmtp.py LMTP_PORT not defined
- [done] use_poll and granularity in config
- [done] Added nowait to global for debugging locks
- [done] Hash to avoid duplicate process (e.g. failed to connect output server)
- [done] Address check should be now rfc compliant
- [done] Make separate hashdb for each backend
- [done] Add support for @mail.domain1.com:email@domain2.com
- [done] Unix sockets permissions are 0777
- [done] Fix rfc821 syntax (a@host, b: etc + <+Mailbox>)
- [done] Remove all variables named "type" to avoid shadow of type()
- [done] Code/log cleanup, checked with pychecker, lmtp has some harmless warning
- [done] Make daemon - switch user - getopt cmdline args
- [done] Why shutdown is so slow? default granularity is 10, it should be ok
- [done] Null return path mails should be in whitelist
- [done] Add an E_TRACE with connections
- [done] Fix loglevel/debuglevel in lmtp.py
- [done] Remove the archiver id header of whitelist mails or storage backend will process it
- [done sometime buggy] Fix thread locking stuff - hooked accept and channel _del_ method
- [done] Add a prefix to logs
- [done] Doxygen-ize: all methods are documented, still needed additional docs
- [checked] sendmail method need extensive checks
- [done] Win32 port with ntservice support
- [done] py2exe wrapper
- [done] nsis installer for win32
- [partially done] check if unmimified stuff can be inserted in the rdbms (check/convert char encoding?)
- [done] extract sender if no from is in header, extract to from recipents if not to is in header
- [done] datefromemail controls the date field, set it to 1 to use date extraction from email
- [done] timeout option is honored if using python2.3 or greater
- [done] explicit depends on python >= 2.3 for socket timeout, True/False
         and bug in rfc822 address parsing of python2.1
- [done] use chdir('/') on daemonize
- [done] added message-id as additional processed data

- Modify init script to take params from /etc/defaults also permission checks for logfile etc
- Make debian package
- Make README.txt
- Unmimify attachment filenames?
- Unmimify email addresses?
- Add an info about unix socket + asyncore problem
- Update postfix templates
- Check -> sendmail: Some of recipients rejected / mail is expunged from hashdb, correct?
- Update structure.txt: stage to stage passthrough - maybe usefull on win32
- Consider to converting doc to epydoc, it's better than doxygen with python since it's native
- Convert some fields in lowercase before archiving?
- Update rdbms driver to psycopg2
- Fix: Error parsing to/cc: Undisclosed-Recipient
- Option to Skip spam tagged mail
- Check init script if the archiver is already launched, pidfile is overwritten/removed ??
- implement timed reload of quota hash depending on modified timestamp
  to avoid reloading each check
- make compression ratio check in various compressors
